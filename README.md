# PANDS-WEEKLY-TASKS repozitory

This repository contains files with weekly tasks and exercises for the Programming and Scripting module.
Each task is organized by week and includes practical coding challenges, scripts, and documentation that demonstrate my progress and learning throughout the course.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by week, and each folder contains:
- Python scripts for weekly assignments

## Topics Covered

- Python basics: Variables & Data Types (Strings, floats, ints, lists, and dictionaries)  
- Input/Output (Using input() to get user input and print() to display results)
- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else for decision making)
- Loops (while\and\for loops for repetition)
- Functions (Writing reusable code with def and using return values)
- String Methods (e.g., .count(), .lower() for analyzing text)
- File Handling (Opening, reading, and processing text files (with open(...))
- Working with libraries (e.g., `math`, `datetime`)
- Basic scripting and automation
- Numerical & Data Analysis Topics
- Data Visualization (with Matplotlib)
