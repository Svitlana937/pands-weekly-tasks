# PANDS-WEEKLY-TASKS repozitory

This repository contains files with weekly tasks and exercises for the Programming and Scripting module.
Each task is organized by week and includes practical coding challenges, scripts, and documentation that demonstrate my progress and learning throughout the course.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by week, and each folder contains:
- Python scripts for weekly assignments

## Topics Covered

- Python basics: variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements and loops
- Functions and modules
- File handling
- Exception handling
- Working with libraries (e.g., `math`, `datetime`)
- Basic scripting and automation
